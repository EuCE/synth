Where we make things that make weird sounds

##Organization

For those not familiar with Git, check this out:

For those not familiar with Github,

- The wiki is for general information sharing, for example, information on Arduionos, potential feature lists, links to tools, etc.
- The issues section is for tracking bugs and features. Basically, anything substantial change that needs to be made to the repository can have an issue.
- Anything that's needed to actually make the project should go in the repository. So code, documentation, schematics, etc.

##Technologies

- Since Nikhil and I have [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno)s, I think we should use those.
- The Arduino Uno uses an [ATmega328](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc8161.pdf) AVR uC.
- AVRs are usually programmed in C, and Arduino add some useful libraries for them. You can get the Arduino editor/builder at [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

##Where to Start

I'll upload a simple synthesizer to the repo soon and I'll post some resources on audio synthesis. Once we get that going, we can decide on what basic features we want this thing to have.
